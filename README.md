## `Frontend task - displaying a list of restaurants with sort functionality`

### `This project is a pre-assignment for wolt summer internship position.`

Overview for the project:<br />

"A list of restaurants is an important element in Wolt app. Depending on where our customers are located, they will be able to order food from few dozen or even from hundreds of different restaurants. Views in the app (Discovery, Search, Delivers, Nearby) sort restaurants based on the delivery time, popularity, rating and various other factors when trying to find the most relevant matches for each customer."

"Build a web page that shows all fifty restaurants. You can freely decide which fields to utilize from restaurants objects, so no need to put all the data visible. However, please use at least three fields.

There are no restrictions on design, so restaurants can be displayed vertically, horizontally, on a grid or however you decide. Aim for clear and responsive design.

In addition of rendering restaurants, create a possibility to sort restaurants alphabetically in ascending and descending order, e.g. by adding a sort-button on the top of the list."


I have used json-server to serve the data given in json format.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Script to run the project: 

## `npm install` 

First install all the packages needed for running the project.

## `npm run json-server`

To serve the data on json-server.

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
