## `Frontend task - displaying a list of restaurants with sort functionality`

# `This project is a pre-assignment for wolt summer internship job application 2020.`

Overview for the project:
"A list of restaurants is an important element in Wolt app. Depending on where our customers are located, they will be able to order food from few dozen or even from hundreds of different restaurants. Views in the app (Discovery, Search, Delivers, Nearby) sort restaurants based on the delivery time, popularity, rating and various other factors when trying to find the most relevant matches for each customer."

I have used json-server to serve the data given in json format.
